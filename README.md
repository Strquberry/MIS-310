# PROJECTS
This is where I am putting the projects that were done in the course.

Some of these assignments were done independently.
Included are two individual assignments, Number 7 and the Midterm.
It also includes several scripts that we went over in class. Those being Rock-Paper-Scissors.
This program is a simple version of rock paper scissors that keeps count of how each game ends

The Grade program
The Kilometer program


The property tax calculator.
Which is a program that can calculate the expected property tax that will be paid when purchasing a home.

And lastly The random number without exceptions program.
This is a simple Dice rolling game that gives the user an option to play again.
